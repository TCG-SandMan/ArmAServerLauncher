# ArmAServerLauncher

A series of batch files designed to make running an ArmA 3 Server easy!  
These are not originally my work however I have modified them to make them very easy to deploy and customize.
If you open each batch file, there is a config at the top of each.  Please follow the instructions there and you should be set to go!
